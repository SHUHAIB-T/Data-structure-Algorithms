# Spanning tree
It the subgraph of a graph which contain all the vertices and n-1 edges. where n is the number of vertices.

- Kruskal's algorithm, Prim's algorithm

## Prim's algorithm,
    - start with vertx having the minum weight on the edges
    - take the vertex which has less weight and connected to the current vertex
## kruskal's algorithm,
    - always take the vertex containing the minimum weight.
